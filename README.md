## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Toni, a **Full Stack Software Developer** (specializing in **JavaScript** & **Python Applications**). I am a **Computer Science & Engineering** too, but plan to never use my degree.

👨‍💻 I enjoy contributing to **Open Source Projects** and have contributed to several Gigantic Organizations including, **Material UI**, **Microsoft**, **Amazon**, **Webhint**, and countless others. I am exceptionally enthusiastic about learning new technology & take great pride in my ability to pick up skills swiftly.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from **break dancing**, **paddle tennis**, and **guitar** to some whacky ones like **writing with my left hand**.

📚 I love reading books on **personal development** & **financial literacy**. My favorite ones are **The Compound Effect** by **Darren Hardy** in the personal development genre and **Rich Dad Poor Dad** by **Robert Kiyosaki** in the financial literacy genre.

✈️ I am in love with **traveling**! I have been on numerous solo trips across **SouthEast Asia**, namely **The Philippines**, **Bali**, **Thailand**, **Bhutan**, **Nepal**, and several others
